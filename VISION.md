# Vision

This document provides an overview of the vision for this project.

## Current State

An experimental project to learn about multi-agent management systems.

## Short-Term Goals

A minimalist multi-agent management system that includes the following:

- Running a gateway with the CLI or Desktop application
- Support for large language models running locally (via Ollama)
- Support for at least one communication channel (i.e. Telegram)
- Support for at least one skill (i.e. managing an Obsidian vault)
- A modular architecture that makes it easy to extend the above

## Long-Term Goals

An advanced multi-agent management system with a strong focus on privacy.
