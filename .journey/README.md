# User Journeys — Manual Testing

This directory contains step-by-step journeys for manually testing Chai functionality. Use them to verify behavior after changes or before release.

Each file is a single journey: prerequisites, steps, and expected outcomes. Keep steps minimal but enough to complete the flow.
